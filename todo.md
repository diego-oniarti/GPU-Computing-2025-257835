# Implementations
1. CPU
        - [ ] COO
        - [ ] CSR
2. GPU
        - [ ] COO
        - [ ] CSR
        - [ ] CSR + shared mem
        - [ ] CSR + shared mem + thread grid?

# Data
For each method:
- 2 warmup runs
- 10? timed runs
- avg time
- mean and standard derivation
- uniform sparse matrix
- some funky distribution (e.g. only the bottom right corner filled in)

More complex to get:
- FLOPs
- Bottlenecks
